## Pymaceuticals

### Overview

The data from most recent animal study that included 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. 
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ 
drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository to your local machine
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory(Pymaceuticals)
Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook (jupyter notebook)
Step 4: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate the notebook file (pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb) and open it.
Step 5: Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. You can do this by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift + Enter, or by selecting Cell > Run All from the menu.

### Result
On execution of the script, data visualizations and statistical analysis results will be displayed which has been the key in the study of the Capomulin, treatment regimen
against other regimens.
